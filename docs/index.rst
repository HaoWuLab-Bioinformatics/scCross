``scCross``  A Deep Learning-Based Model for integration, cross-dataset cross-modality generation and matched muti-omics simulation of single-cell multi-omics data. Our model can also maintain in-silico perturbations in cross-modality generation and can use in-silico perturbations to find key genes.
